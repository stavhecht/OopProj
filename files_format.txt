Files format for adv-world.steps and adv-world.result

adv-world.steps:
- Format:
SEED <number>
<count>
<tick> <player> <key>
<tick> <player> <key>
...

(Note: The first line is slightly different in the implementation (raw number vs SEED keyword) but let's document what the code does or adapt it. The code `Steps.cpp` currently writes raw numbers. I should stick to `Steps.cpp` implementation or update it. `Steps.cpp` writes `randomSeed` newline `count` newline.)

Let's update `files_format.txt` to reflect the actual `Results` format we just implemented.

adv-world.result:
- Lines record events using the keywords:
  ROOM_CHANGE <tick> <player> <toRoom>
  LIFE_LOST   <tick> <player>
  RIDDLE      <tick> <room> |Q <question> |A <answer> |OK|FAIL
  GAME_END    <tick> <totalScore>
